# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Summary
- **Dataset:** UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (569 samples, 30 features)
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
- **Best Result:** SVM achieved 97% accuracy with strong precision and recall


## 📌 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection significantly increases survival rates. Machine learning techniques can assist medical professionals by analysing diagnostic measurements and identifying patterns associated with malignant tumors.

The goal of this project is to develop predictive machine learning models capable of classifying tumors as malignant or benign using diagnostic features extracted from cell nuclei. The project evaluates multiple classification algorithms and identifies the most influential features that contribute to accurate cancer detection.

By comparing model performance and analysing feature importance, this project demonstrates how predictive analytics can support early-stage cancer diagnosis and assist clinical decision-making.

**early cancer detection**.


## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset  
- **Samples:** 569  
- **Features:** 30 numerical diagnostic features  
- **Target Variable:** Diagnosis (Malignant / Benign)

Each feature represents characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness.

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing
The dataset is relatively clean, but several preprocessing steps were applied:

- Removed non-informative columns (`id`, unnamed column)
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Reduced dimensionality by removing highly correlated features
- Handled outliers using capping instead of removal
- Encoded target variable (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)
- Split data into training and testing sets (70% / 30%)

These steps helped reduce noise, avoid overfitting, and improve model stability.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand feature distributions, correlations, and class differences.

### Diagnosis Distribution
The dataset contains more benign cases than malignant cases, indicating a mild class imbalance.

### Feature Correlation
Strong correlations were observed between size-related features such as **radius**, **perimeter**, and **area**, which informed feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

### Unsupervised Clustering
K-Means clustering (after dimensionality reduction) showed a clear separation between malignant and benign cases, suggesting that the underlying data structure supports effective classification.
